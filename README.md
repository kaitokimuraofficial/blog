## Architecture
### Frontend
I am the one who uses [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) mainly as Frontend languages. Following facts below is enough to use this amazing language.
- Type safety because of static typing languages
- Type inference making it easier to develop systems
- Support for JavaScript


### Backend
We use [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/) as backend. The reasons for choice are following.
- Efficiency and type safety thanks for static typing compiled languages
- Ease of implementing concurrency processing
- Simple grammar
- The noticeable growing use of Golang in programming communities


### Database
[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/), one of the world's most popular open source databases is used in this repository. What makes me think MySQL is the best choice for this application is listed below.
- Being one of the most commonly used databases
- Having various examples of using Golang and MySQL, like Golang official document Tutorial, [Tutorial: Accessing a relational database](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/database-access)
